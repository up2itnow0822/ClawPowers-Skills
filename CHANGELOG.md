# Changelog

All notable changes to ClawPowers are documented here.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Native acceleration layer** (parity with ClawPowers-Agent): `native/` Rust workspace (wallet, tokens, policy, fee, x402, canonical, compression, index, verification, security, ffi, WASM crate, PyO3 bindings).
- **Pre-built WASM** in `native/wasm/pkg-node` and `native/wasm/pkg` so npm installs work **without** `wasm-pack` or Rust.
- **3-tier TypeScript loader** (`src/native/index.ts`): Tier 1 optional `.node` addon, Tier 2 WASM, Tier 3 pure TypeScript fallbacks. Exported from the package root (`getActiveTier`, `isNativeAvailable`, `isWasmAvailable`, `getCapabilitySummary`, `computeSha256`, `digestForWalletAddress`, `tokenAmountFromHuman`, `calculateFee`, `evaluateWriteFirewall`, etc.).
- **Payment bridges** (`calculateTransactionFee`, `createPaymentHeader`, `generateWalletAddress`) and **memory bridges** (`getBestCanonicalStore`, `compressVector`, `evaluateWriteSecurity`, …) via `src/payments/native-bridge.ts` and `src/memory/native-store.ts`.
- **npm scripts:** `build:native`, `build:wasm`.
- **WASM / native Keccak-256** for wallet address digest when Tier 1 or Tier 2 is active; **SHA-256** remains the Tier 3 fallback only.

### Notes

- Tier 1 (native) is **optional**; building `native/ffi` requires Rust locally. Published tarballs focus on Tier 2 WASM + Tier 3 TS.
- Backward compatible at the **API** level for v2.0.0 importers; wallet **address strings** for newly generated keys may differ from v2.0.0 when WASM/native is loaded (Keccak-256 vs former SHA-256-only digest). Existing keyfiles keep their stored `address` field.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### Breaking Changes

- **Complete TypeScript rewrite.** The v1.x shell-script runtime has been replaced with a fully typed TypeScript library.
- **No agent control loop.** ClawPowers is now a pure capability library — bring your own agent framework.
- **ESM-only.** Requires Node.js 20+.

### Added

- **Payments module** — x402 detection (`detect402`), `SpendingPolicy` enforcement, `PaymentExecutor` with append-only audit log. Fees: 0.77% tx / 0.30% swap.
- **Memory module** — `WorkingMemoryManager` (in-process, token-budgeted), `EpisodicMemory` (JSONL append-only), `ProceduralMemory` (atomic JSON), `CheckpointManager` (crash recovery), `ContextInjector` (relevant memory selection).
- **RSI module** — `MetricsCollector`, `HypothesisEngine`, `MutationEngine`, `ABTestManager`, `RSIAuditLog`, `AutoResearcher`. Full measure → hypothesize → mutate → A/B test → promote/rollback cycle.
- **Wallet module** — `WalletManager`, `generateWallet`, `importWallet`, `signMessage` with AES-256-GCM encryption at rest.
- **Skills module** — `discoverSkills`, `loadSkillManifest`, `SkillExecutor` with outcome tracking.
- **Config module** — Zod-validated config, dot-notation access, profile support.
- **Framework demos** — LangChain (`demos/langchain.ts`), Claude Code (`demos/claude-code.md`), ElizaOS (`demos/elizaos.ts`).
- **231 TypeScript tests** — full coverage across all modules.
- **BSL 1.1 license** with Change Date April 3, 2030.
- **SECURITY.md** with vulnerability reporting policy and security design principles.

### Compatibility
