# things-mac

This Hermes-compatible skill wrapper exports the ClawPowers catalog entry for `things-mac`.

## Purpose

Manage Things 3 via the `things` CLI on macOS (add/update projects+todos via URL scheme; read/search/list from the local Things database). Use when a user asks OpenClaw to add a task to Things, list items, or search tasks.

## When to use

Use this skill when the task matches the capability described above.

## Current branch note

This wrapper is included so Hermes can discover and load the ClawPowers skill surface from this branch. It reflects the cataloged capability and category from ClawPowers.

## Source of truth

- Catalog source: `src/skills/catalog.ts`
- Catalog entry source class: `openclaw-bundled`
- Category: `productivity`

## Compatibility boundary

This wrapper makes the skill discoverable and loadable by Hermes as a standard `SKILL.md` bundle. It does not, by itself, claim that every underlying runtime, CLI, API integration, or library dependency behind the broader ClawPowers ecosystem is fully configured in Hermes.
